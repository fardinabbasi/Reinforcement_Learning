# Reinforcement Learning

## [Deep RL](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Deep_RL)
Exploring deep reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly focusing on the implementation and testing of algorithms like **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** and **Dueling DQN**.

## [Tabular RL](https://github.com/fardinabbasi/Tabulated_RL)
Containing a custom-built Reinforcement Learning environment and implementations of key RL algorithms like  **Q-learning**, **SARSA**, **n-step Tree Backup**, and **Monte Carlo**, tested in scenarios such as a drone navigation challenge and the Frozen Lake environment.
